Introduction
Parkinson’s Disease is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer’s, affecting more than 10 million people worldwide. Parkinson’s is characterized primarily by the deterioration of motor and cognitive ability.
This repository explores a machine learning approach to accurately diagnose Parkinson’s disease using speech analysis, leveraging a dataset from the University of Oxford.
Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to provide a comprehensive exploration of machine learning algorithms applied to Parkinson's disease diagnosis through speech analysis. It aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis compared to traditional methods.
